**Project Scope:**

This project was created to test our Database management system skills at Maters of Management Analytics at McGill University. The programming language used was SQL (Python was also used to extract the data from CSV files and create INSERT INTO commands for different tables but was out of scope for this project so has been removed). 

Our goal was to consider a use case and implement the techniques learned in DBMS to create an optimal dataset and then write queries that can be used to resolve issues that could be of immense value to the business. 

The DBMS topics covered are:

1. Why do we need DBMS? How DBMS Works?
1. Data Modelling (Entity, Attribute, Identifier, Relationship) – ERD Diagrams, Data Dictionary, Relational Schema
1. DDL, DML commands
1. Aggregate Functions
1. Correlated Subqueries
1. Normalization 
1. Indexing
1. Views
1. Sub Queries


**Overview of the business scenario** 


“S” (The hypothetical name for the e-commerce store, this name will  be used going forward to refer to the store) belongs to the alcoholic-beverages industry and its main goal is to sell alcoholic beverages by offering a broad range of quality products providing an excellent and personalized consumer experience.



In general terms, the Company needs to store information related to the relevant entities in its business model such as products, orders, clients, stores, transactions, among others in order to strengthen business performance and make critical business decisions.

**Functionalities included in the database**

The next screenshots show the main functionalities and aspects that the database 

1. **Products.** The first main functionality of the website is that the users can see the different alcoholic beverages per category (beer, wine and spirits) and the main characteristic of each one. Additionally, the users can filter the products based on the categories, price, size, among other variables. These characteristics are part of our database

2. **Cocktails.** The second functionality is that users can view different cocktails, and the website shows them the alcoholic beverages required to make a certain cocktail . The cocktail entity will include recipes, ingredients, category, difficulty level, etc. to make diverse cocktails and the recommended products from the Company to elaborate them

3. **Recipes.** The Recipes entity will include food recipes and the information about category, preparation time, ingredients, among other. Another important functionality, is that each recipe will have pairings and recommendations with products of the Company

4. **Wine.** The database will have a separate entity for Wine from the Products entity because it will include more detailed information about the wine products such as Acidity, Sweetness, Body, Grape variety, among others. The Products entity will include the other types of products such as beers, ciders, etc that don’t have such information. 

5. **Reviews and bookmarks** The Reviews will contain Attributes such as Rating, Comment and Data of review. Bookmark will be used by user to bookmark a product for future reference. 


6. **Others.** The database will include other entities that don’t have a visual representation in the website such as clients, stores and inventory but that are useful for the Company. 

**Business Processes**

Inventory analysis: analysis is conducted on the inventory at the store & Company level to evaluate performance

Sales: the products, recipe suggestions, and discounts are analyzed for their revenue generation, in addition to the conversion rate to sales from the bookmark feature

Targeted marketing : by building customer profiles, S can tailor promotional campaigns based on the purchasing history of the customer

**Mission statement**

The purpose of the Company database is to maintain the data that the company generates, supply information to support the sales business and improve the customer service operations

**Mission Objectives:** **The mission objectives are split into four components:**

1. **Maintenance** of the data for each entity

2. **Perform** **searches** on specific key measurables

3. **Tracking** key performance indicators

4. **Reporting** on key business processes per unit (store and user)

**Future Scope:**

1. Semi Structured Database – Since some products were used in cocktail and therefore had additional attributes, We could have used Semi Structured data.
1. Conversion from OLTP to OLAP – We could have implemented transformation to  denormalize the dataset so that it can be used to create a data warehouse for various analytical purposes.  

This project was build by 4 students of McGill MMA cohort including myself for the DBMS course.
